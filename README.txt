# 1) I completed steps 1-6 to the best of my capability, was having issues with ProjectC so it was very difficult to verify my work but I did still give it all my time and effort.
# 2) These steps are verfiable to a certain extent with trying to launch the test OS, but there are some compiling issues sadly so I would compare to working code.
